# FishNet

CNNs to identify types of fish. The saved model was trained to 93% accuracy on training data and 83% accuracy on testing data. It suffered from overfitting through most of the process, so after playing around with it for a few days I decided this was good enough.

I used this dataset for my training, so naturally it can only identify these types of fish: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khaledelsayedibrahim/fishclassifyfinal

Longer term goal is to use this model to train other models that can create images that are supposedly fish of a specific species.
